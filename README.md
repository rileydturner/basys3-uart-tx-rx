# basys3-uart-tx-rx
SDSU Lab project to create a Universal Asynchronous Transmitter and Receiver (UART) device to serially receive and transmit 8-bit data.

This process will be done using the Basys3 Board and connected both receiver and transmitter files through a top module. Using PuTTY, the keyboard press from my keyboard will be received then transmitted back into the PuTTY screen.
